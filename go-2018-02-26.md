# Go (2018-02-26)

Someone suggested we learn Go so we learned Go.

But first, the unclub’s name was identified as politically incorrect, “progunclub = pro-gun-club.”  It was suggested that it change to “programmingunclub” but that was deemed too long. So it was changed to the diminutive “punclub” and nobody had a better idea so there it is.

Now Go. File: hello.go: 

```
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
fmt.Println("hello world")
}
```

Compile & run:

```
$ go build hello.go
$ ./hello
```

Next, the inimitable Fizz Buzz challenge. After abundant bad attempts characteristic of undergrads, we finally arrived at a correct implementation:

```
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    for i := 1; i <= 100; i++ {
        if i % 15 == 0 {
            fmt.Println("fizzbuzz")
        } else if i % 3 == 0 {
            fmt.Println("fizz")
        } else if i % 5 == 0 {
            fmt.Println("buzz")
        } else {
            fmt.Println(i)
        }
    }
}
```

Note the “else if” must appear on the same line as the closing brace of the previous if. C'est la vie.

Next, we practice with a special Go feature, “channels,” which are like pipes, as well as “goroutines,” which are like threads.

```
package main

import "fmt"
import "time"
import "strconv"

func dostuff(c (chan string), id int, counter *int) {
    time.Sleep(2e9)
    *counter++
    c <- ("ping" + strconv.Itoa(*counter) + " " + strconv.Itoa(id))
}

func main() {
    withstuff := make(chan string)

    counter := 0

    go dostuff(withstuff, 5, &counter)
    go dostuff(withstuff, 4, &counter)
    fmt.Println("done sending")

    // collect all channel data (possibly wait?)
    msg := <-withstuff
    fmt.Println(msg)
    msg = <-withstuff
    fmt.Println(msg)
}
```

Note that the dostuff functions happen simultaneously so it only sleeps 2 seconds overall (that’s 2 billion nanoseconds if you didn’t know). Also we saw that Go supports regular pointers and thereby lost all credibility.  Castigat ridendo mores.

Finally, we built a dictionary persistent store just because.

```
package main

import "bufio"
import "os"

func saveMap(m map[string]string, fname string) {
    f, _ := os.Create(fname)
    w := bufio.NewWriter(f)
    for k, v := range m {
        w.WriteString(k + "\xFE" + v + "\xFF")
    }
    w.Flush()
    f.Close()
}

func readMap(fname string) map[string]string {
    f, _ := os.Open(fname)
    w := bufio.NewReader(f)
    m := make(map[string]string)
    for {
        k, _ := w.ReadString(0xFE)
        v, e := w.ReadString(0xFF)
        if e != nil {
            break
        }
        m[k[:len(k)-1]] = v[:len(v)-1]
    }
    f.Close()
    return m
}

func main() {
    m := make(map[string]string)

    m["foo"] = "bar\nbaz"
    m["quux"] = "quuux"

    saveMap(m, "m.map")
    m2 := readMap("m.map")
    saveMap(m2, "m2.map") // same contents as m.map, omg!
}
```
